    "# BONUS (Optional). Violations of Linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "For some Optional data exploration, use the first cell (#nonLinReg) to simulate a dataset where the relationship between the predictor and the outcome are non-linear, meaning they violate the assumption of linearity. Use the second cell (#LinReg) to simulate a dataset where the relationship between the predictor and the outcome are linear. For both, create plots of 1) the predictor vs the outcome, 2) the predicted values vs the error and 3) a histogram of the errors.\n",
